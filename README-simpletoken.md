# Simple Token

## Run Guide

To run this program, run:
```bash
leo run mint <mint-inputs>
leo run transfer <transfer-inputs>  # update private key first
```

Be sure to use `leo run` with the correct function and inputs as detailed in the `.leo` program. An example has been provided in the terminal for you. Using `leo run` will also compile the `.leo` file to aleo instructions (`.aleo`).
