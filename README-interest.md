# Interest Calculation

This program provides utilities for calculating interest over a fixed or bounded number of iterations.

## Running the Program

To run this program, run:
```bash
leo run <function-name> <inputs>
```

where `<function_name>` is one of the following:

* `fixed_iteration_interest`
* `bounded_iteration_interest`

Be sure to use `leo run` with the correct function and inputs as detailed in the `.leo` program. An example has been provided in the terminal for you. Using `leo run` will also compile the `.leo` file to aleo instructions (`.aleo`).
